Hi everyone, my name is Eilon Mokryn, I am a junior economics student. I have worked mostly with Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn when I took Data Bootcamp last semester. I am proud of my final project for that class where I worked with 2 classmates to create a fully automated trading algorithm that uses real time data.
